# DecisionTree

This is code for a decision tree binary classifier and regressor using either regression or classifier nodes. It takes in a Pandas dataframe from the user and a dictionary mapping each feature to whether it is a discrete or continuous feature for split algorithms. After training on the dataframe, the tree can predict using a dictionary mapping each feature to the feature value.
